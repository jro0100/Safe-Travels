# Safe-Travels
My Current Work in Progress of a Text Based Adventure Game Called Safe Travels.
The game is to be a spinoff of "The Oregon Trail".

How the game works:
  1. You are travelling across the country in a wagon.
  2. The group of travelers consists of the Wagon Leader(you) and four family members(wife and three kids).
  3. The Wagon Leader directs all the decisions in the game, such as what to buy, how much to stock up on, and when to stop and         explore.
  4. The goal of the game is to make it across the country without your family dying.
  5. You lose if everyone in your family dies before making it across the country.
  6. Your family may face multiple obstacles along the way such as getting robbed, wagon wheel breaking, and most importantly disease.
  7. It is your job to manage the inventory of food, water, medicine, wagon parts, etc.
  8. Every few turn, you will reach a landmark. Upon reaching this landmark, you may stop to explore and approach the merchant. You can buy from or sell to the merchant to keep certain items in stock.
  9. Do note that at each landmark, the merchant will be offering different prices on the items you can buy and sell.
  10. The Wagon Leader(you) start off the game with $1,000 cash, nothing in your inventory, and 3,000 miles of trail you must complete.
  
  Good Luck!
